# Push swap

The aim of this project is to sort a stack of numbers with the least amount of operations in ascending order. The operations that the program is allowed to use are specified in the subject, and the program prints them to the standard output. The algorithm used to perform this operations is the mechanical turk. You can read more about it here: (https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97).

You can find all the information needed in the subject pdf and the restrictions to the arguments that you can pass to the program.
